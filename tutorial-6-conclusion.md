# Part 6 - Conclusion


1. This is ultra mega simplistic : no real scale, no network domains, no security... DO NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN PUT A REAL CLUSTER IN PRODUCTION after this tutorial.
2. Inspirational : Kubernetes community is simply great.
3. Micro-services: keep it simple in order to benefit from Kubernetes even when stateful. Note difference between template (part 5) and managed service: difference between devops and noops.
4. Very very different : everyone need to get a bit into it so that they understand the limitations (there is no magic...) but also grab the potential (huge productivity gains) with a cost (upskill people - different mindset, and refactor the code).
