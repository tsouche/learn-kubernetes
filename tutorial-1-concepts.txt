=====================
1 - Kubernetes Basics
=====================

This tutorial provides a walkthrough of the basics of the Kubernetes cluster
orchestration system. Each module contains some background information on
major Kubernetes features and concepts. You will actually deploy and manage 
a simple cluster and its containerized applications by yourself.

Following the tutorial steps, you can learn to:

  - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster
  - Deploy a simple containerized application on a cluster, scale it, update 
    it with a new software version, debug it.
  - Deploy a more complex containerized application with a stateful datastore,
    and scale/update jointly the application and the data store.

I purposedly copied some reference documentation from the official Kubernetes
site on design and architecture because it is examplary of the philosophy 
underlying the whole Kubernetes project: clarity of purpose translated in the 
ability of distributed teams to efficiently contributes into a larger goal, 
native and forceful openness of the design, resilience-by-design deeply 
embeded in the implementation of every layer. It is REMARKABLE and should be a 
source of inspiration in many Orange endeavours...



===================================
2 - What can Kubernetes do for you?
===================================

With modern web services, users expect applications to be available 24/7, and 
developers expect to deploy new versions of those applications several times 
a day.

Kubernetes coordinates a highly available cluster of computers that are 
connected to work as a single unit. The abstractions in Kubernetes allow 
you to deploy containerized applications to a cluster without tying them 
specifically to individual machines. To make use of this new model of 
deployment, applications need to be packaged in a way that decouples them 
from individual hosts: they need to be containerized. 

    KUBERNETES CAN MANAGE CONTAINERIZED APPLICATIONS ONLY

Containerized applications are more flexible and available than in past 
deployment models, where applications were installed directly onto specific 
machines as packages deeply integrated into the host. Kubernetes automates the 
distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster in 
a more efficient way.


Kubernetes is a production-ready, open source platform designed with Google's 
accumulated experience in container orchestration, combined with best-of-breed 
ideas from the community.


A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:

    - The Master: it coordinates the cluster
    - The Nodes: they are the workers ion which the applications run


(picture: cluster Diagram)


The Master is responsible for managing the cluster. The master coordinates 
all activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, 
maintaining applications' desired state, scaling applications, and rolling 
out new updates.

A Node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in 
a Kubernetes cluster. Each Node has a Kubelet, which is an agent for 
managing the Node and communicating with the Kubernetes Master. The Node 
should also have tools for handling container operations, such as Docker or 
rkt. A Kubernetes cluster that handles production traffic should have a 
minimum of three Nodes.

When you deploy applications on Kubernetes, you tell the Master to start 
the application containers. The Master schedules the containers to run on 
the cluster's Nodes. The Nodes communicate with the master using the 
Kubernetes API, which the Master exposes. End users can also use the 
Kubernetes API directly to interact with the cluster.

A Kubernetes cluster can be deployed on either physical or virtual 
machines. In our case, Part 2 shows how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on 3 
VMs running on your local machine: it is good enough for educational pruposes, 
but it obviously is not representative of a 'real' cluster (which typically 
gathers hundreds of physical servers).



=========================
3 - K8s Community Mindset
=========================

I have decided to quote here the introduction of the project by the community 
itself, as it is to me exemplary of the 'mindset' which has enabled to set one 
of the most formidable open source platform ever (to which maybe only linux 
can be compared), both in its remarkable engineering foundations, but also in 
the way this 'mindset' is day-in-day out demonstrated in action.


3.1 - Scope
===========

Kubernetes is a platform for deploying and managing containers. Kubernetes 
provides a container runtime, container orchestration, container-centric 
infrastructure orchestration, self-healing mechanisms such as health checking 
and re-scheduling, and service discovery and load balancing.

Kubernetes aspires to be an extensible, pluggable, building-block OSS platform 
and toolkit. Therefore, architecturally, we want Kubernetes to be built as a 
collection of pluggable components and layers, with the ability to use 
alternative schedulers, controllers, storage systems, and distribution 
mechanisms, and we're evolving its current code in that direction. 
Furthermore, we want others to be able to extend Kubernetes functionality, 
such as with higher-level PaaS functionality or multi-cluster layers, without 
modification of core Kubernetes source. Therefore, its API isn't just (or even 
necessarily mainly) targeted at end users, but at tool and extension 
developers. Its APIs are intended to serve as the foundation for an open 
ecosystem of tools, automation systems, and higher-level API layers. 
Consequently, there are no "internal" inter-component APIs. All APIs are 
visible and available, including the APIs used by the scheduler, the node 
controller, the replication-controller manager, Kubelet's API, etc. There's no 
glass to break -- in order to handle more complex use cases, one can just 
access the lower-level APIs in a fully transparent, composable manner.


3.2 - Goals
===========

The project is committed to the following (aspirational) design ideals:

    - Portable. Kubernetes runs everywhere -- public cloud, private cloud, 
      bare metal, laptop -- with consistent behavior so that applications and 
      tools are portable throughout the ecosystem as well as between 
      development and production environments.
    - General-purpose. Kubernetes should run all major categories of 
      workloads to enable you to run all of your workloads on a single 
      infrastructure, stateless and stateful, microservices and monoliths, 
      services and batch, greenfield and legacy.
    - Meet users partway. Kubernetes doesn’t just cater to purely greenfield 
      cloud-native applications, nor does it meet all users where they are. 
      It focuses on deployment and management of microservices and 
      cloud-native applications, but provides some mechanisms to facilitate 
      migration of monolithic and legacy applications.
    - Flexible. Kubernetes functionality can be consumed a la carte and (in 
      most cases) Kubernetes does not prevent you from using your own 
      solutions in lieu of built-in functionality.
    - Extensible. Kubernetes enables you to integrate it into your 
      environment and to add the additional capabilities you need, by 
      exposing the same interfaces used by built-in functionality.
    - Automatable. Kubernetes aims to dramatically reduce the burden of 
      manual operations. It supports both declarative control by specifying 
      users’ desired intent via its API, as well as imperative control to 
      support higher-level orchestration and automation. The declarative 
      approach is key to the system’s self-healing and autonomic capabilities.
    - Advance the state of the art. While Kubernetes intends to support 
      non-cloud-native applications, it also aspires to advance the 
      cloud-native and DevOps state of the art, such as in the participation 
      of applications in their own management. However, in doing so, we 
      strive not to force applications to lock themselves into Kubernetes 
      APIs, which is, for example, why we prefer configuration over 
      convention in the downward API. Additionally, Kubernetes is not bound 
      by the lowest common denominator of systems upon which it depends, such 
      as container runtimes and cloud providers. An example where we pushed 
      the envelope of what was achievable was in its IP per Pod networking 
      model.


===========================
4 - Kubernetes Architecture
===========================


4.1 - Working principles
========================

A running Kubernetes cluster contains:
    - one or several Master(s) which operate the cluster control plane (AKA 
        Master), and 
    - several Nodes which communicate with and are managed by the Master 
        thanks to the Kubernetes REST APIs.

(image: Kubernetes architecture)

The Kubernetes REST API supports primarily CRUD operations (Create, Read, 
Update, Delete) on the state information: this API enable the Master to 
send orders to the Nodes such as 'start a pod', 'stop a pod', and also enable 
a Node to send updated status information to the Master (in order, for 
instance,  that the Master keep a global view on the resources available in 
the cluster).

The Master stores all 'state' data on a distributed storage system (which is 
etcd in the current implementation).

Kubernetes’s API provides:
    - container-centric primitives such as Pods, Services, and Ingress, to 
        manage underlying resources (compute, storage, network): it may be 
        compared to the IaaS-type of APIs which enable to manage VMs, keeping 
        in mind that Kubernetes can ONLY manage containers; 
    - lifecycle APIs to support 'orchestration' (self-healing, scaling, 
        updates, termination) of common types of workloads, such as:
        - ReplicaSet (simple fungible/stateless app manager), 
        - Deployment (orchestrates updates of stateless apps), 
        - Job (batch),
        - CronJob (cron),
        - DaemonSet (cluster services), and 
        - StatefulSet (stateful apps).

Service naming/discovery and load balancing are deliberately decoupled from 
application implementation, since the latter is diverse and open-ended.

Both user clients and components containing asynchronous controllers interact 
with the same API resources, which serve as coordination points, common 
intermediate representation, and shared state. 




Controllers are a fundamental object in Kubernetes: a Controller is an agent
which is started by the Master, in order to reach an objective, such as for 
instance deploying a given number of instances of an application on the 
cluster.

Controllers are given one input: the 'desired state'. With this targt, they 
work continuously to drive the actual state towards the desired state, while 
reporting back the currently observed state for users and for other 
controllers.

While the controllers are level-based (for instance: 'deploy 3 replicas of 
this application') to maximize fault tolerance, they typically watch for 
changes to relevant resources in order to minimize reaction latency and 
redundant work. This enables decentralized and decoupled choreography-like 
coordination without a message bus.

One of the most important notion to acquire is how to properly describe a 
'desired state' and to feed it to the Master, so that the Master will do all 
the job for you.
Most resources contain metadata, including labels and annotations, fully 
elaborated desired state (spec), including default values, and observed state 
(status). These metadata are typically described in YAML files, which are very
useful to actually manage a Kubernetes cluster.




Let's now get into a bit more detail about the various components of 
Kubernetes, and how they interoperate, before we actually practice with Parts 
2, 3, 4 and 5 of the tutorial.


4.2 - Cluster control plane (AKA master)
========================================

The Kubernetes control plane is split into a set of components, which can all 
run on a single Master node, or can be replicated over several Master nodes in 
order to support high-availability clusters, or can even be run on Kubernetes 
itself (AKA self-hosted).

The main logical components of the Master are:


API Server
==========

The API server serves up the Kubernetes API. It is intended to be a relatively 
simple server, with most/all business logic implemented in separate components 
or in plug-ins. It mainly processes REST operations, validates them, and 
updates the corresponding objects in etcd (and perhaps eventually other 
stores). Note that, for a number of reasons, Kubernetes deliberately does not 
support atomic transactions across multiple resources.

Kubernetes cannot function without this basic API machinery, which includes:

    - REST semantics, watch, durability and consistency guarantees, API 
      versioning, defaulting, and validation
    - Built-in admission-control semantics, synchronous admission-control 
      hooks, and asynchronous resource initialization
    - API registration and discovery

Additionally, the API server acts as the gateway to the cluster. By 
definition, the API server must be accessible by clients from outside the 
cluster, whereas the nodes, and certainly containers, may not be. Clients 
authenticate the API server and also use it as a bastion and proxy/tunnel to 
nodes and pods (and services).


Cluster state store
===================

All persistent cluster state is stored in an instance of etcd. This provides 
a way to store configuration data reliably. With watch support, coordinating 
components can be notified very quickly of changes.


Controller-Manager Server
=========================

Most other cluster-level functions are currently performed by a separate 
process, called the Controller Manager. It performs both lifecycle functions 
(e.g., namespace creation and lifecycle, event garbage collection, 
terminated-pod garbage collection, cascading-deletion garbage collection, 
node garbage collection) and API business logic (e.g., scaling of pods 
controlled by a ReplicaSet).

The application management and composition layer, providing self-healing, 
scaling, application lifecycle management, service discovery, routing, and 
service binding and provisioning.

These functions may eventually be split into separate components to make them 
more easily extended or replaced.



Scheduler
=========

Kubernetes enables users to ask a cluster to run a set of containers. The 
scheduler component automatically chooses hosts to run those containers on.

The scheduler watches for unscheduled pods and binds them to nodes via the 
/binding pod subresource API, according to the availability of the requested 
resources, quality of service requirements, affinity and anti-affinity 
specifications, and other constraints.

Kubernetes supports user-provided schedulers and multiple concurrent cluster 
schedulers, using the shared-state approach pioneered by Omega. In addition to 
the disadvantages of pessimistic concurrency described by the Omega paper, 
two-level scheduling models that hide information from the upper-level 
schedulers need to implement all of the same features in the lower-level 
scheduler as required by all upper-layer schedulers in order to ensure that 
their scheduling requests can be satisfied by available desired resources.


b) The Kubernetes Node
======================

A Pod always runs on a Node. A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may 
be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each Node 
is managed by the Master. A Node can have multiple pods, and the Kubernetes 
master automatically handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the 
cluster. The Master's automatic scheduling takes into account the available 
resources on each Node.

Every Kubernetes Node runs at least:

    - Kubelet, a process responsible for communication between the Kubernetes 
      Master and the Node; it manages the Pods and the containers running on a 
      machine.
    - A container runtime (Docker in our case) responsible for pulling the 
      container image from a registry, unpacking the container, and running the 
      application.

Containers should only be scheduled together in a single Pod if they are 
tightly coupled and need to share resources such as disk.

Key Kubernetes commands (via kubectl):

You can use Kubectl command-line interface to get information about deployed 
applications and their environments. The most common operations can be done 
with the following kubectl commands:

    kubectl get - list resources
    kubectl describe - show detailed information about a resource
    kubectl logs - print the logs from a container in a pod
    kubectl exec - execute a command on a container in a pod

You can use these commands to see when applications were deployed, what their 
current statuses are, where they are running and what their configurations are.

Now that we know more about our cluster components and the command line, let's 
explore our application.

The Kubernetes node runs the services necessary to host application containers 
and be managed from the master systems :


Kubelet
=======

The most important and most prominent controller in Kubernetes is the Kubelet,
which is the primary implementer of the Pod and Node APIs that drive the 
container execution layer. Without these APIs, Kubernetes would just be a 
CRUD-oriented REST application framework backed by a key-value store (and 
perhaps the API machinery will eventually be spun out as an independent 
project).

Kubernetes executes isolated application containers as its default, native 
mode of execution, as opposed to processes and traditional operating-system 
packages. Not only are application containers isolated from each other, but 
they are also isolated from the hosts on which they execute, which is critical 
to decoupling management of individual applications from each other and from 
management of the underlying cluster physical/virtual infrastructure.

Kubernetes provides Pods that can host multiple containers and storage volumes 
as its fundamental execution primitive in order to facilitate packaging a 
single application per container, decoupling deployment-time concerns from 
build-time concerns, and migration from physical/virtual machines. The Pod 
primitive is key to glean the primary benefits of deployment on modern cloud 
platforms, such as Kubernetes.

API admission control may reject pods or add additional scheduling constraints 
to them, but Kubelet is the final arbiter of what pods can and cannot run on 
a given node, not the schedulers or DaemonSets.

Kubelet also currently links in the cAdvisor resource monitoring agent.


Container runtime
=================

Each node runs a container runtime, which is responsible for downloading 
images and running containers.

Kubelet does not link in the base container runtime. Instead, we're defining 
a Container Runtime Interface to control the underlying runtime and facilitate 
pluggability of that layer. This decoupling is needed in order to maintain 
clear component boundaries, facilitate testing, and facilitate pluggability. 
Runtimes supported today, either upstream or by forks, include at least docker 
(for Linux and Windows), rkt, cri-o, and frakti.


Kube Proxy
==========

The service abstraction provides a way to group pods under a common access 
policy (e.g., load-balanced). The implementation of this creates a virtual 
IP which clients can access and which is transparently proxied to the pods in 
a Service. Each node runs a kube-proxy process which programs iptables rules 
to trap access to service IPs and redirect them to the correct backends. This 
provides a highly-available load-balancing solution with low performance 
overhead by balancing client traffic from a node on that same node.

Service endpoints are found primarily via DNS.


Add-ons and other dependencies
=================================

A number of components, called add-ons typically run on Kubernetes itself:
    - DNS
    - Ingress controller
    - Heapster (resource monitoring)
    - Dashboard (GUI)


c) Pods
=======

When you deploy an application on a cluster, Kubernetes creates a Pod to host 
your application instance. A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a 
group of one or more application containers, and some shared resources for 
those containers. Those resources include:

    - Shared storage, as Volumes
    - Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
    - Information about how to run each container, such as the container image 
      version or specific ports to use

A Pod models an application-specific "logical host" and can contain different 
application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. For example, a Pod 
might include both the container with your Node.js app as well as a different 
container that feeds the data to be published by the Node.js webserver. The 
containers in a Pod share an IP Address and port space, are always co-located 
and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context on the same Node.

Pods are the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform. When we create a 
Deployment on Kubernetes, that Deployment creates Pods with containers inside 
them (as opposed to creating containers directly). Each Pod is tied to the Node 
where it is scheduled, and remains there until termination (according to 
restart policy) or deletion. In case of a Node failure, identical Pods are 
scheduled on other available Nodes in the cluster.


c) Labels and Selector
================================

Everything is about labels!!!

e) Service
==========



e) Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet
=====================================



c) Namespaces
=============

Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical 
cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.


When to Use Multiple Namespaces
===============================

Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across 
multiple teams, or projects. For clusters with a few to tens of users, you 
should not need to create or think about namespaces at all. Start using 
namespaces when you need the features they provide.

Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique 
within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces can not be nested 
inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.

Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users (via 
resource quota).

In future versions of Kubernetes, objects in the same namespace will have the 
same access control policies by default.

It is not necessary to use multiple namespaces just to separate slightly 
different resources, such as different versions of the same software: use 
labels to distinguish resources within the same namespace.

Working with Namespaces
=======================

Creation and deletion of namespaces are described in the Admin Guide documentation for namespaces.
Viewing namespaces

You can list the current namespaces in a cluster using:

$kubectl get namespace
NAME          STATUS    AGE
default       Active    1d
kube-system   Active    1d
kube-public   Active    1d

Kubernetes starts with three initial namespaces:

    - default       The default namespace for objects with no other namespace
    - kube-system   The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system
    - kube-public   This namespace is created automatically and is readable by 
                    all users (including those not authenticated). This 
                    namespace is mostly reserved for cluster usage, in case 
                    that some resources should be visible and readable 
                    publicly throughout the whole cluster. The public aspect 
                    of this namespace is only a convention, not a requirement.

Setting the namespace for a request
===================================

To set the namespace for a current request, use the --namespace flag.

For example:

$ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
$ kubectl get pods --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>

Setting the namespace preference
================================

You can permanently save the namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands in 
that context.

$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>

Validate it
$ kubectl config view --minify | grep namespace:

Namespaces and DNS
==================

When you create a Service, it creates a corresponding DNS entry. This entry 
is of the form <service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local, which means 
that if a container just uses <service-name>, it will resolve to the service 
which is local to a namespace. This is useful for using the same configuration 
across multiple namespaces such as Development, Staging and Production. If you 
want to reach across namespaces, you need to use the fully qualified domain 
name (FQDN).

Not All Objects are in a Namespace
==================================

Most Kubernetes resources (e.g. pods, services, replication controllers, and 
others) are in some namespaces. However namespace resources are not themselves 
in a namespace. And low-level resources, such as nodes and persistentVolumes, 
are not in any namespace.

To see which Kubernetes resources are and aren’t in a namespace:

In a namespace
$ kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true

Not in a namespace
$ kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false
