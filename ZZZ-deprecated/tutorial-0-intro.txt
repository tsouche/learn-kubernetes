This tutorial mixes elements from the official Kubernetes site 'get started' 
sections (many of these), but also from Dada's blog (specifically for setting 
up the Kubernetes clusters on VMs running on a laptop) and other blogs. Main
links are:
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/
    https://www.dadall.info/article658/preparer-virtualbox-pour-kubernetes
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/
    https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/docs/user/access-control/creating-sample-user.md



BE AWARE that the sole purpose of this tutorial is to get you to practise and 
    understand the basics of Kubernetes, but it does NOT give proper 
    guidelines to setup a production environment. Namely, we violate in this 
    tutorial every possible security rule in order to keep things simple, so 
    DO NOT setup a production environment this way.


The tutorial will guide you step by step through:
    - Part 1: getting to know the basic concepts of Kubernetes
    - Part 2: creating and setting up a Kubernetes cluster running on 3 VMs
    - Part 3: deploying a simple app on this cluster
    - Part 4: deploying a more complex (and stateful) app on the cluster
    - Part 5: deploying a Cassandra ring on top of Kubernetes
    - Part 6: conclusion

This tutorial is structured in three documents + many other files:
    - "tutorial-1-concepts.txt" covers the parts 0 and 1 of the tutorial;
    - "tutorial-2-practise.txt" covers the parts 2 to 5 of the tutorial;
    - "tutorial-3-appendix.txt" gathers many useful details, mostly collected 
        from the 'Concept' section of the official Kubernetes site;
    - various pictures whose name point back to the structure of this 
        document, and which are usefull to understand better the Kubernetes 
        concepts or to illustrate some results to be obtained during the 
        execution of the tutorial;
    - a sub-directory "vm-images" contains several VirtualBox VM images used 
        in the part 2 to build the Kubernetes cluster;
    - a sub-directory "yaml" contains various configuration files used in the 
        Part 2 for setting up the kubernetes cluster
    - a sub-directory "app-hello" contains the components of a simple 'hello 
        world' application used in Part 3;
    - a sub-directory "app-guestbook" contains the components of a stateful 
        'guestbook' application used in Part 4;
    - a sub-direcotry "app-cssandra" contains the components of a example of 
        implementation of a cassandra ring ontop kubernetes, used in Part 5.



Here are the identified pre-requisites to run this tutorial and actually
learn something from this experience:

    - have a linux laptop, with a 'admin' account (i.e. need to have
      the sudo privilege). Ubuntu will be perfect for beginners.
    - have curl, git and virtualbox installed


Also, you will find several resources by cloning the git:



This is it. Nothing else is needed... except the desire to learn :-)
